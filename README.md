AveActiveDesktop
================

ActiveDesktop Replacement for Windows 7 (and Vista, and maybe Win8) that mimicks how XP's ActiveDesktop shows a HTML/Site as the background. Special care is taken to mimick the interaction behaviour of the html clickable elements and the folder/icons with the original ActiveDesktop from the XP-era.

1. If you have 32bits Windows, use the files in the 32bits folder. If you have 64bits Windows, use the files in the 64bits folder.

HOW TO STOP?
============
Right-click an empty space on your desktop again and select *"Stop ActiveDesktop"*

HOW TO SET AN URL?
